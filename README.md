At Arcana Pixel, we believe that collaboration is the magic behind every great adventure. By keeping our project Open Source, we empower developers, gamers, and enthusiasts alike to contribute ideas, improvements, and customizations. Your input helps shape the future of this platform, making it a true community effort.

Our project was envisioned and is led by [@TaylorHo](https://github.om/TaylorHo/). His vision is to create a space where creativity meets technology, and where every adventurer can contribute to the epic tale of Arcana Pixel, helping to keep it Open Source.
