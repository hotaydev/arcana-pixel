So we decided to start a longer campaign, with multiple sessions and goals. As the game master, I created an entire world, organized NPCs, enemies, maps, and lore. However, one week before the start, the platform we would use announced the end of their services – without any prior notice!</p><p>With little time to find an alternative, I began searching for other options. Most were paid, offering very limited free versions. Others seemed promising, but they lacked essential features for an RPG, requiring several external tools for notes, maps, character sheets, combat, and communication.</p><p>It's impressive how many <abbr title=\"Virtual Table Top\">VTT</abbr> platforms neglect basic features, forcing players to resort to multiple tools to organize their sessions.</p><p>We decided to change this! We started developing a <strong>100% open-source</strong> tool, ensuring that we would never again need to depend on a platform that could simply cease to exist. Our goal is to gather everything essential for an RPG session, with full support for customization and modularity, allowing anyone to bring their system, rules, maps, homebrew content, and more.</p><p>To make life easier for GMs and players, we're creating optional automations for combat rolls, spells, equipment, sound effects, travel time, and more. Additionally, the platform will be extensible, allowing the community to develop new modules, rules, automations, and custom content.</p><p>Thus, <strong>Arcana Pixel</strong> was born! We're already testing the platform and will soon launch an open version and a Discord server for collaborative suggestions and improvements. We want it to be accessible and built together with the community.</p><p>We plan to offer \"importers\" to facilitate the migration of campaigns and characters. We're already developing processes for <strong>D&D Beyond, Roll20, and Alchemy</strong>!</p><p>We commit to NEVER using any AI-generated images on our platform, out of respect for the talented artists in our community. All material used will always include copyright attributions.</p><p>Our goal is clear: a <strong>100% Free and Open Source</strong> <abbr title=\"Virtual Table Top\">VTT</abbr> platform, capable of running any RPG without relying on multiple tools, ensuring simplicity for GMs and players.</p><p>If you want to be part of this creative and open community, <strong>join us</strong>! Pre-registration is already available, and soon we'll have more news about the platform's development.</p><p>See you soon, traveler!</p></section>",

Either way, prepare your torch and adjust your cape — let's explore this essential concept together for anyone who loves RPGs!</p><h2>What does VTT mean?</h2><p>VTT stands for <strong>Virtual Tabletop</strong>. In essence, it's an online platform that simulates that classic table where, surrounded by people, characters, and stories, we create worlds, face challenges, and share unforgettable journeys.</p><p>In the physical world, we use paper maps, miniatures, character sheets, dice, and lots of imagination. A VTT transports all of this to the digital realm, facilitating remote game sessions, automating rules, and opening new possibilities with visual effects, soundtracks, automatic dice rolls, and much more.</p><h2>Why use a VTT?</h2><p>Besides allowing groups separated by cities, countries, or even continents to continue playing together, a VTT offers tools that make the experience more dynamic and engaging. Imagine having interactive maps, real-time movement, accessible lore anytime, and epic soundtracks that accompany each scene!</p><p>The VTT is the digital grimoire that contains everything: from your character sheet to the illustration of that shadowy creature lurking in the forest.</p><h2>Meet Arcana Pixel: much more than a VTT</h2><p>Here at <strong>Arcana Pixel</strong>, we decided to go beyond the traditional idea of a VTT. Our platform was forged as an <strong>all-in-one</strong>, seamlessly integrating:</p><ul><li><em>Interactive maps and real-time movement</em></li><li><em>Storytelling system with lore and notes, public or private</em></li><li><em>Dynamic and customizable character sheets</em></li><li><em>Immersive visual and sound effects</em></li><li><em>Status control, effects, and automated rolls</em></li><li><em>Integrated communication with voice, text, and video</em></li><li><em>And, of course... dice rolling, with or without the blessing of the gods!</em></li></ul><br /><p>Furthermore, Arcana Pixel is <strong>modular and extensible</strong>: anyone can adapt rules, create new systems, develop automations, or add maps with ease. Our mission is to ensure that each table has its own identity and that creative power is always available to the community.</p><h2>An adventure built together</h2><p>Arcana Pixel is a <strong>collaborative and open</strong> project, where anyone can contribute with code, ideas, or suggestions. Our <a href=\"{github}\" target=\"_blank\">GitHub repository</a> is always ready to welcome new lines of code, while <a href=\"{discord}\" target=\"_blank\">Discord</a> is the lively tavern where we exchange ideas, test new features, and celebrate each small achievement.</p><h2>Ready to cross the portal?</h2><p>If you're looking for a complete, modern, open, and community-shaped tool, Arcana Pixel is your destination. Come be part of this journey and help make the world of VTTs even more magical!</p><p>See you on the other side of the portal, traveler.<br />May the dice roll in your favor! 🎲✨</p></section>"
